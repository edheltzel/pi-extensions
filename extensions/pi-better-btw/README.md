# pi-better-btw

Temporary side conversation overlay for [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi).

Open a temporary, "sidebar", chat session inside the current pi UI, ask something quick, hide it, bring it back, then close it without saving any session history.

## Screenshot

## Install

Install the Atlas extension collection directly from GitHub:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/edheltzel/pi-extensions
```

Pi installs a missing Git package automatically and can update the unpinned collection with:

```bash
pi update git:github.com/edheltzel/pi-extensions
```

For local development, install only this workspace from the monorepo root:

```bash
pi install ./extensions/pi-better-btw
```

This workspace remains private and is not published to npm. Run `/reload` after installation or source changes.

## What it does

`pi-better-btw` is just like other BTW extension but it adds a `/btw` command that opens a floating overlay backed by a separate **in-memory** `AgentSession`.

So:

- it starts with the **same currently selected model** as the main session
- it uses **no persisted session file**
- it renders with native pi components for user messages, assistant messages, thinking blocks, and tool execution cards
- it can be **hidden** without losing the temporary conversation
- when you **close** it, the betterbtw session is disposed completely

## Usage

### `/btw`

Open the betterbtw overlay, then type directly into its UI.

```text
/btw
```

Main flow:

1. run `/btw`
2. the overlay opens
3. type into the betterbtw prompt
4. press `Enter`

### `/btw <prompt>`

You can also pass the first message inline as a shortcut:

```text
/btw what file owns this route?
/btw check how this helper is used across the repo
```

If the overlay is already open, `/btw <prompt>` sends another message into the betterbtw session.
If the overlay is hidden, run `/btw` again to bring it back.

## Controls

The shortcut menu stays pinned to the bottom edge of the overlay.

- `Esc` — close the betterbtw session completely
- `↑` / `↓` — scroll the transcript
- `PageUp` / `PageDown` — scroll faster
- `Home` / `End` — jump to top or bottom
- `Alt+O` — hide the overlay
- `Enter` — send message to betterbtw pi

When hidden, a small widget is shown above the prompt:

```text
/btw is running • alt+o show • run /btw to restore
```

## Behavior

A quick pop-up chat that opens at the latest message and stays in follow mode while new output streams. Scroll up to inspect older output, then use `End` to jump back to live output.

The metadata row beneath the title shows the side conversation's model, current thinking level, throwaway-session state, and working directory, so you can tell at a glance what is answering you and where.

The overlay paints itself with the terminal's own background colour rather than leaving its cells on the default background. Terminals composite their window backdrop behind default-background cells, so without this the desktop shows through the overlay body when terminal transparency or blur is enabled. If the terminal does not answer the colour query, the overlay falls back to drawing without a background.

It has its own temporary conversation state:

- hide it → state stays in memory
- run `/btw` again → continue where you left off
- close it → state is gone

The pop-up session uses the **main session's model at the moment it is created**.
If you change models in the main session later, the already-open betterbtw session keeps using its existing model until you close and reopen it.

## Why

Useful when you want to:

- ask a small side question without polluting the main thread
- inspect a file or run a quick command in parallel
- keep a temporary tangent around while continuing the main conversation

`pi-better-btw` is for those little "btw" moments without leaving the current TUI.

## Requirements

- [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) with extension support
- interactive mode (the overlay is TUI-only)

## Development

Run from the monorepo root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @edheltzel/pi-better-btw test
pnpm --filter @edheltzel/pi-better-btw tsc
```

Run `/reload` in Pi after changing extension resources.
