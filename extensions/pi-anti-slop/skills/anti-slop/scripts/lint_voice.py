"""Layer 0 linter: house style, and nothing more than house style.

READ THIS FIRST. Every finding this tool emits is a house style rule. A
house style rule is a preference the owner of the document chose. It is not
a slop verdict, it is not evidence about who wrote the text, and it must
never be quoted as an authorship signal. Czuma (arXiv 2606.29540,
2026-06-28), pre-registered on 69,632 medRxiv preprints, states the
position this tool adopts verbatim: the em dash is a population-level
indicator, not a per-paper detector of LLM use. Punctuation preference is
a style choice, and detector bias against English-language learners is
peer reviewed and current (Stowe et al., ACL 2026, arXiv 2512.09292).

What it checks:

1. The three forbidden prose characters: U+2014, U+2013, and ASCII
   space-hyphen-hyphen-space.
2. Optional banned tokens from a voice file, one token per line, `#` starts
   a comment.

Both checks run through the same masking machinery the other Layer 0
scanners use, from `scan_common.py`: code blocks in either markdown syntax,
fenced and four-space indented, are skipped, and so are inline code spans.
A document is therefore free to demonstrate the exact character it forbids.

Attribution. The rule set and the fence and backtick handling are derived
from the design of `scripts/lint_prose.py` in claude-blog 2.1.0, which
solved the same problem first. This is a clean reimplementation against the
shared helpers in this repository, not a wrapper: nothing here imports or
executes code from another project, because a linter that only runs on one
machine is a linter that does not run. See the package NOTICE.

Quoted source protection: lines that are markdown blockquotes are exempt by
default. You do not edit punctuation inside somebody else's sentence, so an
en dash in a quoted date range, or an em dash in a quoted citation, is not
a violation. The skipped matches are counted and reported as
`quoted_lines_exempt` rather than silently dropped, and `--include-quotes`
lints them anyway.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/lint_voice.py [PATH ...] [--voice voice.txt]
    cat draft.md | python3 scripts/lint_voice.py --stdin-name draft.md

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 usage error.
